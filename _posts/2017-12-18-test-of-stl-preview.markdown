This is a retaining nut for Deltaprintr users that are also using Tensioning
 knobs from [Thingiverse-1078583](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1078583) by
 [mildmojo](https://www.thingiverse.com/mildmojo).


> Why an extra set of nuts?

> While printing, the action of the pulleys rotating back and forth would

Print in a set of three, drill the inner hole to just under the diameter of
 bolts, then tap with M3.5 threads, screw over existing nuts after pushing
 pulleys back against tensioning knob slider; leave enough play that the pulleys
 are not being squished.
